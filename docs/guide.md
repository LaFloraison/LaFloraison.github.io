Here I'd have a brief introduction about this website. 



> What's this website?  

This is a website I built for sharing my learning experience and notes about science and technology.



> Why do I build this website?  

Here are several reasons:
- 



As is known to us, in most of the universities in China


>What will  I share on this website?  

As is mentioned above, 



>Who's the website for?

- For those who are interested in science and technology.


> About language  

After thinking twice, I decide to write my blog in English. As a native Chinese speaker, it seems a little bit confusing and inexplicable. 

But actually there are sufficient reasons to do so:
- English has its advantages in science and technology.  

>Further planning

- To establish a free knowledge repository about elementary STEM knowledge  with Obsidian, open source on Github and try to build a website to launch it.
- To create accounts on Zhihu or CSDN or other platforms to share some formed articles on this blog.
- To learn Manim, create popular science videos with it, and then share them on Bilibili and Youtube.
- To write articles on my blog and maintain the website. 
- To collect and organize my blogs and repositories into lecture notes with LaTeX when they come into a certain degree of completeness.

> How to use this website?  

> Have a fun time!



>Want to build a website like this?

To be honest, the process of making this website is very simple. This website is completely built by Docsify, GitHub Pages and Doubao.  Even though you don't know anything about coding languages and website design. You can make a website like this in a week.
